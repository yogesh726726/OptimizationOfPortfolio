# Portfolio Risk Analysis and Optimization using Monte Carlo Simulation

- Retrieved and processed historical stock price data for a diversified asset basket using the yfinance API.
  
- Performed comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to assess price trends, volatility, correlations and outliers.
  
- Simulated thousands of random portfolio weight combinations according to Monte Carlo Simulation method. Evaluated
portfolio metrics: expected returns, volatilities and Sharpe ratios.

- Plotted and interpreted the efficient frontier, identifying optimal portfolios under both maximum Sharpe ratio and minimum
volatility criteria.

- Incorporated risk-free rate assumptions to compute risk-adjusted returns; gained practical exposure to diversification, asset
allocation, and market theory.
